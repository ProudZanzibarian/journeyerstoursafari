This was Coastal's first destination and remains one of the most popular for flying safaris. This is rough territory, long distances and frequently flooded roads. The Rufiji River and its tributaries form a large network of lakes and rivers, making it ideal for boat safaris and for observing wildlife from a different perspective."
